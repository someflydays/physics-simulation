# Initial CI tasks with GitHub Actions

## Directory Structure
```
.github/            // GitHub-specific configurations, including GitHub Actions.
└── workflows/      // Defines GitHub Actions workflows for CI.
    └── ci.yaml	    // Automated build and test.
```

This GitHub Actions workflow will serve as an initial step in the continuous integration (CI) pipeline for quick feedback on commits. For instance, it will:

- Automatically check the syntax of the C++ code upon every push.
- Run a small subset of unit tests that don't require the full infrastructure.
- Automatically manage some GitHub repository tasks or issues, like labeling merged pull requests.

GitHub Actions will be used for quick, lightweight CI tasks.
